# Path-Finder
---
This project is designed to find the shortest route between two districts within Haryana.. It is implemented in C++ using Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path. The underlying data structure used is a graph, where each district is represented as a node and the connection between two districts is an edge. 

The program employs object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C++ and offers four user options:  
1. Displaying the adjacency list of the graph.  
2. Finding the shortest route.  
3. Estimating the travel time to a specified city.  
4. Listing nearby districts.  

The graph data is stored in files, which are then imported into the program during execution. I have also attached screenshots of the program for reference.
